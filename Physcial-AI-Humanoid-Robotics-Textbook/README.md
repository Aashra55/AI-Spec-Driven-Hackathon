I have successfully created and ratified the constitution for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" project.

- **New Constitution**: The constitution has been created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and initialized at version `1.0.0`. It establishes five core principles: Clarity and Accessibility, Technical Accuracy and Rigor, Open-Source and Collaborative, Practical Application and Hands-On Learning, and a Maintainable and Extensible Platform.

- **No Manual Follow-up Needed**: I have verified that the existing project templates for plans, specs, and tasks are compatible with the new constitution.

- **Prompt History Record**: A record of this operation has been created at `history/prompts/constitution/001-create-project-constitution-for-robotics-textbook.constitution.prompt.md`.

All changes have been committed. You can view the commit with the following message:
