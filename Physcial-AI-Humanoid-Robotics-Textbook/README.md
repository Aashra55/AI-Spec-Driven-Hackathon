# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This repository hosts the content and development for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook," a comprehensive, hands-on guide bridging the gap between digital AI and its physical embodiment in robots. It covers principles and practices for perceiving, interacting with, and acting in the physical world.

The book is structured into four modules, leading readers from foundational concepts to advanced topics in embodied intelligence:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
